# Inverted Pendulum Control System
This project involves designing state feedback controllers for an inverted pendulum using Ackermann's formula
and optimizing the control system with Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) techniques. It includes simulating the
control system for specified initial and desired values.

### Requirements
Python libraries: 
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

### Features
- Ackermann Controller: Designed using Ackermannâ€™s formula.
- LQR Controller: Optimized using Linear Quadratic Regulator techniques.
- Simulation: Control system simulated for given initial and desired states.
